# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 25, 2021 (Thursday)
##### (Let's get started!)

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Started off the day with checking the rules and FAQ of 100DaysOfCode , registered on twitter and posted the first message.
2. Setting up Git and especally Git in VScode was a challenge but got it too work after an hour of troubleshooting.
3. Started a new Github repo , a portfolio for myself.
... This portfolio will be my first project in the challenge , where I will challenge myself to put my knowledge to the test.
... I plan to use the portfolio to put myself in the market.
4. Made the boilerplate index.html / style.css and app.js , commited and pushed them to Github

**Thoughts:** 
The smallest things can hold you back from getting to actually code, today setting up git again after a period not using it was hard again.
Realized quite quickly that coding every day is so important when it comes to letting things stick. 
Setting up the remote git in vscode was something i did before but somehow the steps i could not remember. Blessings to Github for the good 
documentation.
