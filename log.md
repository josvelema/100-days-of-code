# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 25, 2021 (Thursday)
##### (Let's get started!)

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Started off the day with checking the rules and FAQ of 100DaysOfCode , registered on twitter and posted the first message.
2. Setting up Git and especally Git in VScode was a challenge but got it too work after an hour of troubleshooting.
3. Started a new Github repo , a portfolio for myself.
... This portfolio will be my first project in the challenge , where I will challenge myself to put my knowledge to the test.
... I plan to use the portfolio to put myself in the market.
4. Made the boilerplate index.html / style.css and app.js , commited and pushed them to Github

**Thoughts:** 
The smallest things can hold you back from getting to actually code, today setting up git again after a period not using it was hard again.
Realized quite quickly that coding every day is so important when it comes to letting things stick. 
Setting up the remote git in vscode was something i did before but somehow the steps i could not remember. Blessings to Github for the good 
documentation.

### Day 2: February 26, 2021 (Friday)
##### (I think I Git it)

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Wrestled with CSS to get my navbar working as I want (responsive)
2. Created my own 'hamburger' icon and thinking of a way to make a animation out of it as well
3. Was really annoyed that my git setup was gone again , made it work but it made a copy so have to go over that again.


**Thoughts:** 
Got a bit stuck on how I want things to look like , so thinking of making a mockup first and then code. I also want to look into creating another
project to have more to show on the portfolio. I think 3 days would be enough of having the basic portfolio kind of ready and I can always add more
content / features.

### Day 3: February 27, 2021 (Saturday)
##### (I think I Git it)

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Made a title introduction box with subtle shadow effects.
2. Added a CSS grid with cards for a quick call to action.
3. Worked on the responsiveness by adding flexible font-sizes with calc()
4. Add the 'glass blur' in the navbar.


**Thoughts:** 
I really like nitpicking when it comes to styling with css , it's also a great get away from complexer code . Also getting used to using CSS grid ,
which really is a effective way of getting elements lined up just perfect!  Today was a relaxed day , didn't watch the time because i had plenty and even
went to go hike in the afternoon which was very nice. Also got a message from someone who maybe would like to pair-program with me! It came from some one who saw my post of 100daysofcode so i was amazed that it is really helping if you just put your self out there!
